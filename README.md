# eureka-the-online-learning-website
Eureka is an interactive online learning website developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask.
It is designed to make science education engaging, accessible, and enjoyable for students as well as curious learners.

About the Project
Eureka focuses on four major science subjects:
Biology
Chemistry
Physics
Environmental Science
The platform aims to provide concept-based learning instead of rote memorization. Learners can explore topics at their own pace and gain a deeper understanding of scientific ideas.

Key Features
Topic-wise questions and answers to practice and test knowledge
Interactive explanations that simplify complex concepts
Diagrams and visual aids for better understanding
Real-world applications of science to connect theory with practice

Purpose
The goal of Eureka is to encourage curiosity, support exam preparation, and help learners explore new scientific ideas. By combining structured content with interactive elements, it sparks interest in science and makes learning more meaningful.

Technology Stack
HTML for structure
CSS for styling
JavaScript for interactivity
Flask (Python) for backend support
